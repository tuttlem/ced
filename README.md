### Variant

## Future Ideas

### File I/O Operations

Functions for reading and writing files.
Abstractions for working with directories and file paths.

### Functional Design

Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.).
Specialised data structures for functional programming (e.g., immutable lists).
High performance clone of lists, etc.

### Memory Management

Custom memory allocation and deallocation functions.
Memory pooling or slab allocation for optimized memory usage.

### String Manipulation

String manipulation functions (concatenation, substring, searching).
Regular expression support.

### Mathematics

Mathematical functions (trigonometry, logarithms, etc.).
Random number generation.

### Networking

Basic networking functions (TCP/UDP socket creation, sending/receiving data).
URL parsing.

### Concurrency

Threading and synchronization primitives (mutex, semaphore, etc.).
Thread pooling or task scheduling.

### Time and Date

Date and time manipulation functions.
Timer functions for measuring elapsed time.

### Error Handling

Custom error handling mechanism.
Functions for retrieving error messages.

### Configuration Parsing

Configuration file parsing (INI, JSON, XML, etc.).
Access to environment variables.

### Compression and Encryption

Compression and decompression algorithms (e.g., zlib).
Basic encryption and decryption functions.

### Command-Line Argument Parsing

Parsing command-line arguments easily.
Options for handling command-line flags and parameters.

### Serialization/Deserialization

Functions for converting data structures to/from a serialized format (JSON, XML, binary).

### Data Validation

Input validation functions for common data types.
Regular expression-based validation.

### Multithreading Utilities:

Higher-level abstractions for managing concurrent tasks.
Thread-safe data structures.
